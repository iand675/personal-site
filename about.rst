Hi, I'm Ian.

I'm the Lead Engineer at `Betterteam <https://www.betterteam.com/>`_ where I design, build, and do ops across the whole company.

Prior to that, I spent some time at `CircleCI <https://circleci.com>`_ as one of the early employees, where I did a large amount
of the work building the user interface as it currently stands today. I also did the early exploratory
work in adding support for non-GitHub source control sites such as BitBucket, and prototyped early
versions of the circle.yml V2 configuration and workflow. I continue to nurture a strong passion for developer tooling that makes doing "The Right Thing" easier & faster.

Having worked with a variety of languages including C#, Java, Clojure, Ruby, Javascript and Haskell, I believe that firmly that the biggest wins currently available to programmers are the use of "lightweight formal methods" such as Haskell's type system, property-based testing, and runtime constraints such as those offered in modern SQL. At the same time, many of these tools are bounded by their notion of the universe, and modern computing means that a number of unpredictable distributed computing errors are ever waiting to strike, so I maintain an interest in additional computing techniques (such as idempotency, CRDTs, software-transactional memory) to make systems resilient to failure.

While I have a practical applied interest in program correctness, I also have a deep appreciation for making information accessible, so I differ from many of my fellow functional programming ascetics in that I also endeavour to build polished interfaces that make information accessible and comprehensible. I love being able to conceive of, design, build, and maintain programs, all while keeping them user-focused.

On a personal level, I am currently based out of Sendai, Japan. I am a hobbyist chef, Japanese translator, live-sound engineer, and beverage connoisseur.
